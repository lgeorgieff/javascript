[JSCS](http://jscs.info/) is a tool written in JavaScript for static code analysis of JavaScript files. You can download it at [GitHub](https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs). It offers many configuration possibilities regarding pure syntax style, i.e. no potential semantic erros are checked such as undefined variables. In addition it is plugin-based, i.e. each (linting) rule is a plugin and new rules can be added by implementing and adding plugins to [JSCS](http://jscs.info/).
