_smalloc_ was originally thought to expose functionality that directly handles raw memory and represents it as a buffer in the Node.js runtime. It was marked as experimental and is no longer available (was removed between release 0.12.7 and 4.0.0).

For further information on the API docs of version 0.12.x take a look at the official [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v0.12.x/api/smalloc.html).
