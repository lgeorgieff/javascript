# This Repository
This repository covers some interesting code snippets for learning JavaScript and Node.js

## Node.js
This section provides some JavaScript snippets that are special to Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that is used for server-side JavaScript execution and is based on Google's [V8](https://code.google.com/p/v8/) JavaScript engine.

 1. Node.js [assert](node.js/020_assertions/README.md)
 1. Node.js [globals](node.js/040_globals/README.md)

## Closure Compiler
Google's closure compiler is a JavaScript to JavaScript compiler. It generates a much smaller code version of the input files. It can be used for performace improvement but also for error checking.
